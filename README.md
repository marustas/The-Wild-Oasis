# The Wild Oasis

This repository contains the final project of the "The Ultimate React Course 2024: React, Redux & More" on Udemy by Jonas Schmedtmann. The project demonstrates my proficiency in utilizing various technologies, commonly uses in React-development.

## Technologies Used

- **[Styled components library](https://styled-components.com/)**: Leveraged for effective styling of the web application.
- **[ReactQuery](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/react/overview)**: Utilized for state managing and data fetching in the React application.
- **[React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main)**: Implemented for handling navigation within the application.
- **[Hot Toast](https://react-hot-toast.com/docs)**: Employed for displaying nicely-styled notifications and toasts in the user interface.
- **[Recharts](https://recharts.org/en-US/)**: Utilized for creating interactive and visually appealing charts.
- **[Supabase](https://supabase.com/docs)**: Used for integrating a scalable and performant database solution.

## Key Takeaways

Throughout the development of this project, I gained valuable insights into several key aspects:

### Compound Component Pattern

I learned how to create, manage, and utilize the Compound Component pattern to enhance the modularity and maintainability of the codebase.

### Optimization Techniques

Explored methods to minimize the number of wasteful renders, improving the overall performance of the application.

### File Structure Organization

Organized the project's file structure to enhance readability.

### Styled components Library

Used Styled-components library with the combination of CSS variables and JavaScript to implement darkmode for the application and connect to the user's OS color theme.

### Error Boundaries

Implemented simple error boundaries in the application using the React-Error-Boundary Library to enhance error handling and user experience.

## Acknowledgments

Special thanks to Jonas Schmedtmann for teaching the [Ultimate React course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course/) at Udemy, that provided me with several projects I'm really proud to show in my portfolio. During this course Jonas taught me how to not only think in react and develop user-friendly and performant Single page applications, but he also showed how React works behind the scnes, giving a deeper understanding of this library.
