# The Wild Oasis

This repository contains the final project of the "The Ultimate React Course 2024: React, Redux & More" on Udemy by Jonas Schmedtmann. The project demonstrates my proficiency in utilizing various technologies, commonly uses in React-development.

## Technologies Used

- **Styled-components library**: Leveraged for effective styling of the web application.
- **ReactQuery**: Utilized for state managing and data fetching in the React application.
- **react-router-dom**: Implemented for handling navigation within the application.
- **Hot Toast**: Employed for displaying nicely-styled notifications and toasts in the user interface.
- **Rechart**: Utilized for creating interactive and visually appealing charts.
- **Supabase**: Used for integrating a scalable and performant database solution.

## Key Learnings

Throughout the development of this project, I gained valuable insights into several key aspects:

### Compound Component Pattern

I learned how to create, manage, and utilize the Compound Component pattern to enhance the modularity and maintainability of the codebase.

### Optimization Techniques

Explored methods to minimize the number of wasteful renders, improving the overall performance of the application.

### File Structure Organization

Organized the project's file structure to enhance readability.

### Styled-components Library

Used Styled-components library with the combination with CSS variables and JavaScript to implement darkmode for the application and connect to the user's OS color theme.

### Error Boundaries

Implemented simple error boundaries in the application using the React-Error-Boundary Library to enhance error handling and user experience.

## Acknowledgments

Special thanks to Jonas Schmedtmann for teaching the Ultimate React course at Udemy, that provided me with several projects I'm really proud to show in my portfolio. During this course Jonas taught me how to not only think in react and develop user-friendly and performant Single page applications, but he also showed how React works behind the scnes, giving a deeper understanding of this library.
